Tired of huge bloated Visual Studio? Try SharpSnippetCompiler. It is a tiny C# IDE with all the necessary basic tools:

  * variables watch window
  * stepping through the code
  * assembly references
  * light and fast
  * syntax highlighting
  * IntelliSense code-completion
  * supports .NET 3.5 features

It is envisaged to be a drop-in replacement for the excellent SnippetCompiler (http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler).

SharpSnippetCompiler is based on the excellent SharpDevelop IDE (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/).
